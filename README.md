# dotfiles

2020 vintage.

Debian testing (bullseye at the time), wayland with sway.

I always have 5 applications running;
*  two browsers (`Brave` and `ungoogled-chromium`)
*  `spotify`
*  `emacs` (28, compiled from the `features/pgtk` branch)
*  `xterm` (or similar, e.g. `foot` or `mlterm`)

I run this on three kinds of machines;
*  X220 (assembled from broken ones from eBay)
*  Dell XPS (currently a 15 inch one with 6 cores)
*  Macbook Air (second generation only)
